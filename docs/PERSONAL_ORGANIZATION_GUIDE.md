# Personal Organization System Guide

## Overview

The personal organization system ensures that every user has a dedicated personal workspace that they can never lose access to, while still allowing them to join shared organizations. This solves the critical issue where users would lose access to platform features when removed from or leaving organizations.

## How It Works

### 1. **Personal Organization Creation**
- Every user gets a personal organization during signup (created in `verifyEmail` function)
- Personal organizations are created with `type: 'personal'`
- Default name: `"[FirstName]'s Organization"`
- User is automatically set as owner of their personal organization

### 2. **Organization Types**
- **Personal**: Single-user organizations (member limit = 1)
- **Shared**: Multi-user organizations (member limits based on subscription)

### 3. **User Organization Fields**
- `personalOrganization`: Reference to user's personal org (never changes)
- `organization`: Reference to current active organization (can switch)

## Key Features

### ✅ **No Service Disruption**
- Users always have access to platform features
- Removed/leaving members fall back to personal organization
- Credits remain accessible in personal workspace

### ✅ **Seamless Member Management**
- Admins can remove members without breaking their experience
- Members can leave organizations and continue using the platform
- Organization owners cannot accidentally lock themselves out

### ✅ **Organization Switching**
- Users can switch between personal and shared organizations
- Endpoint: `POST /api/organizations/switch-to-personal`

## API Endpoints

### Organization Management
- `GET /api/organizations/` - Get current organization details
- `PUT /api/organizations/` - Update organization settings
- `POST /api/organizations/invite` - Invite members (shared orgs only)
- `DELETE /api/organizations/members/:memberId` - Remove member
- `POST /api/organizations/leave` - Leave organization
- `POST /api/organizations/switch-to-personal` - Switch to personal org

### Behavior Changes
- **Remove Member**: Member is returned to their personal organization
- **Leave Organization**: User is returned to their personal organization
- **Organization Owner**: Cannot leave (must transfer ownership first)

## Database Schema

### User Model
```javascript
{
  personalOrganization: ObjectId,  // Never changes once created
  organization: ObjectId,          // Current active organization
  organizationRole: String,        // Role in current organization
  isOrganizationOwner: Boolean,    // Owner of current organization
  joinedOrganizationAt: Date       // When joined current organization
}
```

### Organization Model
```javascript
{
  type: String,                    // 'personal' or 'shared'
  name: String,                    // Organization name
  owner: ObjectId,                 // Organization owner
  memberCount: Number,             // Current member count
  memberLimits: Object,            // Per-subscription limits
  credits: Number,                 // Organization credits
  // ... other fields
}
```

## Migration for Existing Users

### Run Migration Script
```bash
node scripts/migrateUsersToPersonalOrg.js
```

This script:
1. Finds users without personal organizations
2. Creates personal organizations for them
3. Sets personal org as current if they have no organization
4. Provides detailed logging and error handling

### Test Implementation
```bash
node scripts/testPersonalOrgImplementation.js
```

This script verifies:
- All users have personal organizations
- Organization types are correct
- Member limits work properly
- User-organization relationships are valid

## Usage Examples

### 1. **Admin Removes Member**
```javascript
// Before: Member loses access to platform
// After: Member is returned to personal organization
DELETE /api/organizations/members/userId
// Response: "Member removed successfully. They have been returned to their personal organization."
```

### 2. **Member Leaves Organization**
```javascript
// Before: Member loses access to platform
// After: Member is returned to personal organization
POST /api/organizations/leave
// Response: "Successfully left organization. You have been returned to your personal organization."
```

### 3. **Switch to Personal Organization**
```javascript
POST /api/organizations/switch-to-personal
// Response: Organization details of personal workspace
```

## Benefits

1. **User Experience**: No service disruption when organization membership changes
2. **Admin Confidence**: Can manage members without worrying about breaking access
3. **Platform Reliability**: Users always have a workspace to fall back to
4. **Credit Continuity**: Each organization maintains its own credits
5. **Data Isolation**: Personal and shared data remain separate
6. **Familiar Pattern**: Similar to Slack/GitHub workspace switching

## Error Handling

### Emergency Fallback
If a user's personal organization is missing:
- System automatically creates one during member removal/leaving
- User is notified and seamlessly transitioned
- No manual intervention required

### Migration Safety
- Migration script handles errors gracefully
- Users without personal orgs are identified and processed
- Detailed logging for troubleshooting

## Future Enhancements

1. **Organization Switching UI**: Frontend interface for switching between organizations
2. **Organization Invitations**: Enhanced invitation system for shared organizations
3. **Workspace Templates**: Pre-configured personal organization templates
4. **Advanced Permissions**: Granular permissions within shared organizations

## Technical Notes

- Personal organizations cannot have additional members
- Organization type is immutable once created
- Personal organizations always have member limit of 1
- Migration is idempotent (safe to run multiple times)
- All existing functionality remains unchanged
